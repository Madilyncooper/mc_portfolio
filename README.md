# Madilyn Cooper Portfolio

A portfolio in the form of a webiste that displays projects I want to be public. 

## Motivation

It is important to me to have all of my web application projects easily accessible to the public in one concise location. This webiste allows me to put my contact info, such as my email and github account, along with any applications I want to showcase, in the convenience of one place. It allows me to be able to have my resume and a short introductory snippet about myself, so that I can present a snapshot of who i am and what i can do to potential clients and employers. I organized the source code so that I can easily evolve any links or styling that I may want to in the future. As I grow and gain more experience with programming, I am sure I will want my portfolio will grow and change as well.
